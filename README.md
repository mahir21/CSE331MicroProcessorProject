# CSE331MicroProcessorProject
This Is Semester Group Project For CSE 331 Course. We Were Required To Implement A Logic Table Using Hardware And Proteus Simulation
#From The Given Truth Table We Converted Our Logic To Aurdino Code And Then Implemented Both HardWare And Proteus Simulation Using Our Code.
#Link For Video Both Hardware and Proteous Simulation Is Given Below
